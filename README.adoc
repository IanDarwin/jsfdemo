== jsfdemo

This is Ian's JSF and Facelets demo project.

It shows Internationalization. To I18N a JSF app:

	* create Properties files for the languages;
	* list the languages in faces-config.xml;
	* f:loadBundle to load the props, and change ALL
		plain text to JSF-EL
		
In the "Blog" feature it shows a traditional JSF bean
used to create and list entities.

It also shows a simple "managed bean"
structure with one data bean and one action bean,
the recommended split that is NOT used in most
introductory examples.

== SECURITY (NOT)

**DO NOT** deploy this webapp on the Internet; you will be eaten by worms
in no time. See OWASP.org to find out what needs to be improved!

== Status 

Compiles under Eclipse; has been mavenized, and still works.
For Wildfly, just use `mvn wildfly:deploy`. For other servers,
see your server's documentation.
