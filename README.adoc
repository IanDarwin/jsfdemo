== jsfdemo

This is Ian's JSF and Facelets demo project.

It shows I18N as well as a simple "managed bean"
structure with one data bean and one action bean,
the recommended split that is NOT used in most
introductory examples.

To I18N a JSF app:
	* create Properties files for the languages;
	* list the languages in faces-config.xml;
	* f:loadBundle to load the props, and change ALL
		plain text to JSF-EL

Should be ready to go!
